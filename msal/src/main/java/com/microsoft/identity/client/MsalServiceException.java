/**
 * This exception class represents errors when communicating to service, could be from authorize endpoint or token endpoint. We'll directly
 * read error and error_description from the server response (redirect for authorize endpoint and JSON response from token endpoint). Those
 * errors generally indicate that they cannot be fixed even if going to UI, developer needs to check about the app configuration on the aad.
 * <p>
 *     Set of error codes that could be returned from this exception:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>invalid_request: This request is missing a required parameter or includes an invalid parameter value or includes a parameter more than
 *         once or is otherwise malformed.</li>
 *         <li>unauthorized_client: The client is not authorized to request an authorization code. </li>
 *         <li>access_denied: The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.</li>
 *         <li>invalid_scope: The request scope is invalid, unknown or malformed. </li>
 *         <li>service_not_available: This is to represent 500/503/504. </li>
 *         <li>request_timeout: This is to represent {@link java.net.SocketTimeoutException}. </li>
 *         <li>invalid_instance: This is returned when authority validation fails. </li>
 *         <li>unknown_error: Request to server failed, but no error and error_description is returned from the service. </li>
 *     </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: {@link MsalServiceException} provides one extra API:
 * </p>

 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link MsalServiceException#getHttpStatusCode()} : indicates the http status code for the failed request.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
