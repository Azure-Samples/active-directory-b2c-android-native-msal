# MSAL Android Sample Microsoft Graph API Sample 

| [Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/guidedsetups/active-directory-android)| [Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android) | [API Reference](http://javadoc.io/doc/com.microsoft.identity.client/msal) | [Support](README.md#community-help-and-support)
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

NOTE: This README is for the Azure AD code sample and is not instructions for using b2c. Please see MASTER branch. 

The MSAL Android preview gives your app the ability to begin using the
[Microsoft Azure Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) by supporting [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. This sample demonstrates all the normal lifecycles your application should experience, including:

* Get a token for the Microsoft Graph
* Refresh a token
* Call the Microsoft Graph
* Sign out the user

## Scenario

This app is a multi-tenant app meaning it can be used by any Azure AD tenant or Microsoft Account.  It demonstrates how a developer can build apps to connect with enterprise users and access their Azure + O365 data via the Microsoft Graph.  During the auth flow, end users will be required to sign in and consent to the permissions of the application, and in some cases may require an admin to consent to the app.  The majority of the logic in this sample shows how to auth an end user and make a basic call to the Microsoft Graph.

## Example

```Java
// Initialize your app with MSAL
PublicClientApplication pApp = new PublicClientApplication(
            this.getApplicationContext(),
            R.raw.auth_config);

// Perform authentication requests
pApp.acquireToken(getActivity(), SCOPES, getAuthInteractiveCallback());

// ...

// Get tokens to call APIs like the Microsoft Graph
authenticationResult.getAccessToken();
```

## Optional: Register your App  

The app comes pre-configured for trying the sample.  If you would like to register your own app, please follow 
the steps below. 

You will need to have a native client application registered with Microsoft using the 
[App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/portal/register-app?appType=mobileAndDesktopApp&appTech=android). 

To create an app,  
1. Click the `Add an app` button inside the *Converged Apps* section.

2. Name your app and select `Create`. 
    - Do not check `Let us help you get started.
    - After the app is created, you'll land on your app management page. 

3. Click `Add Platform`, then select `Native Application`. 
    - The Redirect URI produced is needed when making Auth requests. If you're using MSAL, it will
    be automatically constructed by the library unless you do a custom configuration. 

4. Hit the `Save` button. 

5. Save your `Application/Client ID` and `Redirect/Reply URI` for when you clone the code:
    - Add the `Application/Client ID` to the AndroidManifest.xml's <intent-filter>
    - Add the `Application/Client ID` to the `client_id` value inside `res/raw/auth_config.json`
    - Add the `Redirect/Reply URI` to the `redirect_uri` inside `res/raw/auth_config.json`

## Steps to Run

1. Clone the code. 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-android-native-v2 
    ```
2. Open Android Studio 3, and select *open an existing Android Studio project*. Find the cloned project and open it. 

3. Select *Build* > *Clean Project*. 

4. Select *Run* > *Run 'app'*. Make sure the emulator you're using has Chrome, if it doesn't follow 
[these steps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-general-docs/blob/master/AndroidEmulator.md).

## Security Library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the 
latest version of our library in your app when possible. We 
use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating 
your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures 
you get the latest security and feature enhanements but our API surface remains the same. You 
can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security Reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it 
to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your 
submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) 
program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will 
contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when 
security incidents occur by 
visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing 
to Security Advisory Alerts.
