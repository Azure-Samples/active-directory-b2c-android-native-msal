 * This exception class represents general errors that are local to the library. Given below is a table of proposed codes and a short description of each.
 * <p>
 *     Set of error codes that could be returned from this exception:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>multiple_matching_tokens_detected: There are multiple cache entries found and the sdk cannot pick the correct access token
 *         or refresh token from the cache. When this happens, this usually indicates a bug in the sdk for storing tokens or authority is
 *         not provided in the silent request and multiple matching tokens found, the sdk doesn't know which authority should be used
 *         to get the token for. </li>
 *         <li>device_network_not_available: No active network is available on the device. </li>
 *         <li>json_parse_failure: Indicates that the sdk failed to parse the Json format.</li>
 *         <li>io_error: Indicates that IOException happened, could be the device/network errors. </li>
 *         <li>malformed_url: Indicates that the url is malformed. </li>
 *         <li>unsupported_encoding: Indicates that the encoding is not supported by the device. </li>
 *         <li>no_such_algorithm: Indicates the algorithm used to generate pkce challenge is not supported. </li>
 *         <li>invalid_jwt: JWT returned by the server is not valid, empty or malformed. </li>
 *         <li>state_mismatch: For authorize request, the sdk will verify the state returned from redirect and the one sent
 *         in the request. This error indicates that it doesn't match. </li>
 *         <li>unresolvable_intent: The intent to launch {@link AuthenticationActivity} is not resolvable by the OS or the intent
 *         doesn't contain the required data. </li>
 *         <li>unsupported_url: Unsupported url, cannot perform adfs authority validation. </li>
 *         <li>authority_validation_not_supported: The authority is not supported for authority validation. The sdk supports
 *         b2c authority, but we don't support b2c authority validation yet. Only well-known host will be supported. </li>
 *         <li>chrome_not_installed: Indicates that chrome is not installed on the device. The sdk uses chrome custom tab for
 *         authorize request if applicable or fall back to chrome browser. </li>
 *         <li>user_mismatch: Indicates that the user provided in the acquire token request doesn't match the user returned from server.</li>
